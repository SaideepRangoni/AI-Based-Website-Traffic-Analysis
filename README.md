** Web-Traffic-Analytics-ML-Model **

The Jupyter Notebook contains a detailed exploration of classifying website visitors using logistic regression.

** Description **

This project builds a logistic regression model to classify website visitors as either new or returning.
It uses Google Analytics sample data and BigQuery for data analysis and feature engineering, emphasizing understanding user behavior through descriptive analytics and modeling.

** Features **

** 1. Data Import and Setup **

Uses bigquery library to import data.

Configures the project environment.

** 2. Data Preprocessing **

Cleans and preprocesses data.

Performs feature engineering, handling missing values and encoding categorical data.

** 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) **

Computes descriptive statistics.

Visualizes data trends focusing on bounce rates and session counts.

** 4. Model Building **

Implements logistic regression.

Splits data into training and testing sets.

Tunes hyperparameters for optimization.

** 5. Model Evaluation **

Uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, log loss, and ROC AUC.

Analyzes confusion matrix results.

** 6. BigQuery Analysis **

Runs SQL queries for deeper data insights.

Analyzes traffic sources and bounce rates.

** 7. Results and Conclusion **

Summarizes logistic regression findings.

Discusses limitations and future improvements.

** 8. Visualization **

Uses matplotlib and seaborn for visual insights.

Presents key metrics and model performance visually.
